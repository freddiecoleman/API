API
===

Coinfloor's application programming interface (API) provides our clients programmatic access to control aspects of their accounts and to place orders on the Coinfloor trading platform. The API is accessible via [WebSocket][] connection to `api.coinfloor.co.uk` on port 80 for unencrypted transport and port 443 for TLS transport. Commands, replies, and notifications traverse the WebSocket in text frames with JSON-formatted payloads.

WebSocket connections to the API will time out after 60 seconds of no traffic passing in either direction. To prevent timeouts, send a [Ping frame][] approximately every 45 seconds while the connection is otherwise idle. You do not need to send Ping frames if you are otherwise sending or receiving data frames on the socket.

To protect the performance of the system, Coinfloor imposes certain limits on the rates at which you may issue commands to the API. Please see [LIMITS.md](LIMITS.md).

All quantities and prices are transmitted and received as integers with implicit scale factors. For scale information, please see [SCALE.md](SCALE.md).

Coinfloor has published [client libraries](https://github.com/coinfloor) for several popular languages to aid you in implementing your client application.
